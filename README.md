## The Story
During the pressures of college exams and our commitment to the ALX scholarship, we were all feeling the strain. It was during these moments of shared stress that the seed of our project was planted. We asked ourselves, "Why not create something that could help us easily understand files and engage with AI  just like we'd converse with another person?" We all found this idea incredibly exciting, realizing it can assist many people. And so, Powered by this shared vision, we started on our journey to bring this project to life.
